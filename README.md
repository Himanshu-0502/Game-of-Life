# Game of Life

## Overview

This project is a web-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, built using Flask and Python for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Features

- **Random Initialization**: The grid is initialized with a fixed number of alive cells placed randomly.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid and controls are designed to be responsive and work on various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, Stop, and Reset the simulation with buttons.
