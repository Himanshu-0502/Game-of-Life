# Conway's Game of Life

This project is a web-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, built using Flask and Python for the Backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Frontend.

## Features

- **Random Initialization**: The grid is initialized with a fixed number of alive cells placed randomly.
- **Responsive Design**: The grid and controls are designed to be responsive and work on various screen sizes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Start, Stop, and Reset the simulation with buttons.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Himanshu-0502/Game-of-Life.git

    ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Flask App:
